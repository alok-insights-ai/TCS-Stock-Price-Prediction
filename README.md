# TCS Stock Data Analysis & Prediction

A machine learning project that explores, analyzes, and predicts TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) stock trends using Python and data visualization.

# Project Overview

This project uses historical stock data of TCS to perform:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Visualization

Time-Series Trend Study

Predictive Modeling using Machine Learning

The goal is to extract insights from TCS stock patterns and understand the market behavior.

# Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

Google Colab

# Insights & Results

Found correlation between closing price and moving averages.

Identified seasonal trends and volatility patterns.

Trained ML model (like Linear Regression / RandomForest) for price prediction.

Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Future Work

Integrate LSTM for better time-series prediction.

Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit.

Add live stock data fetching.

# Sample Visualizations
